# Project Bootstrap Rule

Always read these files at the start of every new chat session:

- `pionex_futures_bot_setup.md`
- `pionex_futures_bot/OPERATIONS.md`

Purpose:
- Ensure the assistant aligns with the project context, goals, constraints, and operational procedures each time.
- Avoid Linux shell assumptions. Use Windows PowerShell syntax and prefer `py` for Python launcher. Use the venv Python for project execution.
- Prefer short commands and `.venv` as the default virtual environment folder name; adapt paths if a custom name is used.
